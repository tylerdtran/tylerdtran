🌱 I am a UCLA Undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Linguistics, minoring in Data Science Engineering. 
<br /> 
📚 I am interested in and hoping to work in the intersection between software engineering, cloud computing and database systems.

Aside from Computer Science, I love playing tennis, going on spontaneous adventures, cooking Asian Food at home, and traveling the world . 
I have an insatiable desire to learn more about anything and everything in this world. My hope is that through my github repositories you get 
to see one way I exercise my eagerness to learn.
